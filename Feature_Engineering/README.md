# Feature Engineering
feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data . This improves the performance machine learning model.
- Everyone has their apporach of performing feature engineering
Substeps of feature engineering:
- Feature transformation (transforming a column so that it performs better)
    -  Missing Value Imputation 
    - Handling Categorical Features ( one - hot encoding= converting a string value to numerical value)
    - Outlier Detection 
    - Feature Scaling
- Feature construction (Some features are manually created in data as the presence of these features will provide better results )
- Feature Selection ( Selecting the important features and removing the unimportant)
- Feature Extraction ( Extracting new features from the already given features programaticaly by using some algorithms) (PCA , LDA etc.)
